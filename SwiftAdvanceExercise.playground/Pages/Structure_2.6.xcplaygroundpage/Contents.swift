/*Reason
    The reason you can change a mutable property of a let constant class instance, is due to the fact that classes are reference types. Therefore being a let constant only ensures that the reference stays the same. Mutating their properties doesn't in any way affect your reference to them â€“ you're still referring to the same location in memory.
